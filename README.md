# NAME

PDL::IO::CSV - Load/save PDL from/to CSV file (optimized for speed and large data)

# SYNOPSIS

    use PDL;
    use PDL::IO::CSV ':all';

    my $pdl = rcsv2D('input.csv');
    $pdl *= 2;
    wcsv2D($pdl, 'double.csv');

    my ($pdl1, $pdl2, $pdl3) = rcsv1D('input.csv', [0, 1, 6]);
    wcsv1D($pdl1, 'col2.csv');
    #or
    $pdl2->wcsv1D('col2.csv');
    $pdl2->wcsv1D('col2_tabs.csv', {sep_char=>"\t"});

# DESCRIPTION

The traditional way of creating PDL piddle from CSV data is via [rcols](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::IO::Misc#rcols) function.

    my $pdl = rcols("data.csv", [1..4], { DEFTYPE=>double, COLSEP=>"," });

This module provides alternative implementation based on [Text::CSV\_XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::CSV_XS) which should be significantly faster than
traditional approach.

PDL::IO::CSV supports reading CSV data and creating PDL piddle(s) as well as saving PDL data to CSV file.

# FUNCTIONS

By default, PDL::IO::CSV doesn't import any function. You can import individual functions like this:

    use PDL::IO::CSV qw(rcsv2D wcsv2D);

Or import all available functions:

    use PDL::IO::CSV ':all';

## rcsv1D

Loads data from CSV file into 1D piddles (separate for each column).

    my ($pdl1, $pdl2, $pdl3) = rcsv1D($csv_filename_or_filehandle);
    #or
    my ($pdl1, $pdl2, $pdl3) = rcsv1D($csv_filename_or_filehandle, \@column_ids);
    #or
    my ($pdl1, $pdl2, $pdl3) = rcsv1D($csv_filename_or_filehandle, \%options);
    #or
    my ($pdl1, $pdl2, $pdl3) = rcsv1D($csv_filename_or_filehandle, \@column_ids, \%options);

Parameters:

- csv\_filename\_or\_filehandle

    Path to CSV file to be loaded or a filehandle open for reading.

- column\_ids

    Optional column indices (0-based) defining which columns to load from CSV file.
    Default is `undef` which means to load all columns.

Items supported in **options** hash:

- type

    Defines the type of output piddles: `double`, `float`, `longlong`, `long`, `short`, `byte`.
    Default value is `double`. **BEWARE:** type \`longlong\` can be used only on perls with 64bitint support.

    You can set one type for all columns/piddles:

        my ($a, $b, $c) = rcsv1D($csv, {type => double});

    or separately for each column/piddle:

        my ($a, $b, $c) = rcsv1D($csv, {type => [long, double, double]});

- fetch\_chunk

    We do not try to load all CSV data into memory at once; we load them in chunks defined by this parameter.
    Default value is `40000` (CSV rows).

- reshape\_inc

    As we do not try to load the whole CSV file into memory at once, we also do not know at the beginning how
    many rows there will be. Therefore we do not know how big piddle to allocate, we have to incrementally
    (re)allocated the piddle by increments defined by this parameter. Default value is `80000`.

    If you know how many rows there will be you can improve performance by setting this parameter to expected row count.

- empty2bad

    Values `0` (default) or `1` - convert empty cells to BAD values (there is a performance cost when turned on).
    If not enabled the empty values are silently converted into `0`.

- text2bad

    Values `0` (default) or `1` - convert values that don't pass [looks\_like\_number](https://metacpan.org/pod/Scalar::Util#looks_like_number)
    check to BAD values (there is a significant performance cost when turned on). If not enabled these non-numerical
    values are silently converted into `0`.

- header

    Values `0` (default) or `N` (positive integer) - consider the first `N` lines as headers and skip them.
    BEWARE: we are talking here about skipping CSV lines which in some cases might be more than 1 text line.

- decimal\_comma

    Values `0` (default) or `1` - accept `,` (comma) as a decimal separator (there is a performance cost when turned on).

- encoding

    Optional enconding e.g. `:utf8` (default `undef`) that will be applied on input filehandle.

- debug

    Values `0` (default) or `1` - turn on/off debug messages

- sep\_char

    Value separator, default value `,` (comma).

- and all other options valid for [new](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::CSV_XS#new) method of [Text::CSV\_XS](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::CSV_XS)

## rcsv2D

    #or
    my $pdl = rcsv2D($csv_filename_or_filehandle, \@column_ids);
    #or

    #or
    wcsv1D($pdl1, $pdl2, $pdl3, $csv_filename_or_filehandle);
    #or
    wcsv1D($pdl1, $pdl2, \%options); #prints to STDOUT
    #or
    wcsv1D($pdl1, $pdl2);

    # but also as a piddle method
    $pdl1D->wcsv1D("file.csv");

    Path to CSV file to write to or a filehandle open for writing. Default is STDOUT.

Items supported in **options** hash:

- header

    Arrayref with values that will be printed as the first CSV line.

- bad2empty

    Values `0` or `1` (default) - convert BAD values into empty strings (there is a performance cost when turned on).
